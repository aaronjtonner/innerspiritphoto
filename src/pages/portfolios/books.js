                Each of our books is unique and handcrafted. We strive to make
                your vision a reality with a variety of different, artistic
                treatments done to your book image selections .
              </p>
              <p>
                It takes a few weeks for your images to be retouched and
                enhanced then your layout is designed. Before the book leaves to
                be printed in an Italian castle by a mostly female staff, you
                view and approve our layout design. Printing time depends on the
                bookmaker???s volume flow, book type, and accessories, taking from
                one to six weeks to produce.
              </p>
              <p>
                We call you as soon as it arrives. We have women gasping and
                crying upon seeing the emotional beauty of themselves in their
                own hardcover book!
              </p>
              <p>
                Your books are available in many styles from traditional to the
                very latest trend. For example, we have a 9 X 13 inch book with
                a steel cover and a storybook with a soft leather style cover,
                the page edges delicately ripped. There are various styles of
                hardcover book, some that can hold a video screen in the top lid
                of their box.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sizes vary, colors abound and there are a dazzling array of
                finishes and accessories.
              </p>
              <p>
                We think it is kind of cool to have, Printed in Italy in your
                book. It is a statement.
