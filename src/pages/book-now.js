        review="I had just turned 50 when I found myself unexpectedly single. I felt sad and angry, and my inner spirit needed some serious healing. 

        Doing boudoir with Mark was a way for me to get my divine femininity power back, and I needed that to move forward with my new single life.
        
        Since then, I have achieved a whole new way of seeing myself. The empowering experience with Inner Spirit gave me the confidence to ignite a new acting and modelling career alongside my matchmaking career. I also received an amazing opportunity to share my gifts as an empath with the world, doing a docuseries about my expertise on dating, healing your past relationships, and connecting with your intuition.
        
        Mark captured my true essence — boudoir photography at Inner Spirit ignited my divine strength, and I now own my feminine strength.

When you see yourself through a photographer's lens, beautiful and sexy, it will change the way you see yourself forever. You'll be able to look back at these photos years from now and still feel confident and empowered"
